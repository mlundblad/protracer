Protracer is a simple raytracer originally written in 1999 as a university
course project.
Please beware that, despite the name, there is nothing especially professional
about Protracer. The name is meant to be a pun on the Protracker music tracker
application.

Protracer is now released under the GNU General Public License.

Protracer currently supports a very limited subset of the POV-Ray file format.

To install run
$ ./configure
$ make
and (as root)
# make install

To process a scene description you can run a command like:

$ protracer -o output.ppm input.pov

Where input.pov is the input scene description and output.ppm is the output in
PPM format (this is the only possible output format right now).

For a list of available options, run:

$ protracer --help

Test script:

Protracer comes with a test script.
To run the test script you would first need to run "make" from the source
directory.
Then run the test script from the "test" directory:

cd test
./tests.sh

This will produce PPM image files for all the examples included with the source.
