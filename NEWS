version 2.6 (2012-xx-xx)

version 2.5 "May-tracer" (2012-05-06)
	* Bugfix: Fix rotation of discs working properly.
	* Enhanced scene description language:
	  * Added support for the functions max_extents and min_extents
	    to get the bounding box coordinates (as vectors) of a declared
	    object.

version 2.4 "Springtracer" (2012-04-23)
	* Enhanced scene description language:
	  * Added numerical constants "image_width" and "image_height"
	    set to the image width and height (in pixels).
	  * Add support for moving and rotating light sources and cameras
	    with the "translate" and "rotate" keywords.

version 2.3 "Friday the 13th"(2012-04-13)
	* If started interactively (i.e. not reading input from a pipe), print the
	  usage help if no input file is given.
	* Enhance scene description language:
	  * Support the function "vaxis_rotate" to rotate a given vector around
	    another vector describing an axis by a specified amount in degrees
	    and the function "vrotate" to rotate a vector around each of the
	    axis (x, y, and z) by the amount specified by the second vector
	    argument.
	  * Support moving objects with the "translate" keyword.
	  * Support rotating objects with the "rotate" keyword.
	  * Support declaring and using transformation variables.

version 2.2 "March" (2012-03-19)
	* Enhance scene description language:
	  * Support declaring variables hold scalar values, vectors, colors,
	    pigments, finishes, cameras, light sources, and objects.
	  * Support modifying the pigment and finish of an object
	    (for intantiating an object from a declared variable).
	  * Support arithmetic and logical operators on vector expressions.

version 2.1 "Two Candles" (2011-12-04)
	* Enhance scene description language:
	  * Support specifying floating point literal values in scientific
	    notation.
	  * Support basic arithmetic operators (+-*/) for floating point
	    expressions.
	  * Support the following built-in functions for floating point values:
	    abs, acos, asin, asinh, atan, atanh, ceil, cos, cosh, degrees, div,
	    exp, floor, int, ln, log, max, min, mod, pow, radians, select, sin,
	    sinh, tan, tanh.
	  * Support floating point constants: false, no, off (=0),
	    on, true, yes (=1) and pi.
	  * Support logical operators =,!=,<,<=,>,>=,& (and) ,| (or),! (not).
	  * Support the conditional ternary operator (expr ? val1 : val2)
	    for floating point and vector values.
	  * Support the basic arithmetic operators +,- for vector expressions.
	  * Support the following built-in functions for vector values:
	    vcross, vdot, vlength, vnormalize.
	  * Support built-in vector constants x,y, and z for unit vectors in the
	    respective dimensions.
	  * Support casting a floating point value to a vector
	    (with all elements set to that value, for example 0 to specify
	    origo).
	* Support the new geometric object "disc" (only using single-color
	  pigment for now).

version 2.0 (2011-10-26)
	* Re-written in C++.

version 1.0 (2011-07-01)
	* Switch to using automake for building.
	* Fix building on Windows.
	* Changed command line syntax to be consistent with other Unix-like tools.
	* Allow piping both input and output files.
	* Added example files.

version 0.9 (2011-05-29)
	* Re-license in GPL.
	* Added README.

version 0.8 (1999)
	* Initial released code.
